unbeatable tic-tact-toe

##How to run it?
The code runs on Python3+ and dev env used Python3.7.0 in particular.

Once downloaded, you can simply run tictactoe.py and it will start.

##How to run tests?
Tests run on top of py.test for simplicity reasons. `requirements` for pip is provided.
Specifically the tests are contained inside `board_test.py` so you can simply run
`py.test board_test.py`
